## Project Title: Multilingual Routing Application
Description:
 This project is a web application with dynamic multilingual support. The goal of the project is to provide seamless language switching for users while navigating different routes, ensuring an enhanced user experience for global audiences.

## Key Features:
Language Localization: Implemented dynamic language switching using i18next/react-intl (or the library you are using).
Route-Based Language Change: The application updates the language automatically based on the URL or user actions.
Translation Management: Added support for multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish) with organized translation files for better scalability.
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across devices and user interfaces.
Reusable Components: Created modular and reusable React components that adapt to the selected language.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js
Routing: React Router (or any routing library you're using)
Localization Library: i18next/react-intl
Version Control: GitHub
Implementation Steps:
Initialized the project using React and added necessary dependencies for localization and routing.
Configured i18n.js/localization.js for managing language translations dynamically.
Implemented route-specific logic to trigger language changes.
Added fallback logic to default to English if no language is specified.
Updated components to support translated text using useTranslation/FormattedMessage.
Tested the application for different languages and edge cases.
